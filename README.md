This is my personal dotfiles, download/clone and install with install-dotfiles.sh which will create a symbolic link to these dotfiles from here to their expected location
except for zshenv which will be copied over to /etc/zsh/zshenv

I probably should symlink zshenv as well or make everything consistenly copy instead of symlink. I'll decide in the future.
